## Google Teapot Page

Clone of the Google Teapot Page for Error 418

This code was defined in 1998 as one of the traditional IETF April Fool's jokes, in
RFC 2324, Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol, and is not expected to be implemented by actual HTTP
servers.

## Features

(1) Click on the teapot, it will start to pour tea.

(2) If you are on a mobile device and tilt the device, it will also pour tea into the cup.

## Original Page

Google has their own page for it at https://www.google.com/teapot 

## Optimizations
While improving this project, I would start by implementing the following features -

   1. <s>Making it mobile responsive</s>
   2. Randomly showing different facts about Error 418 
              
## Lessons Learned
I learned about different HTTP response codes and how they are classified into groups.I learned about different Client error responses, one of them was Error 418.
My learning was focused on creating a similar error handling page like google which shows a animated teapot pouring the tea in the teacup on clicking it.
